# Customer-churn

## üéØProject Overview
This project aims to analyze customer churn behavior and build a predictive model to identify customers at risk of leaving a service. The goal is to uncover key factors influencing churn and provide actionable insights for retention strategies.

## üìÅ Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about customer demographics, services subscribed, account details, and whether the customer has churned. Key features include:
- Customer ID
- Gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents
- Tenure, Contract, Payment Method
- MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges
- Churn (target variable)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- **Language**: R
- **Libraries**: `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `lubridate`
- **Reporting**: GitHub README (no R Markdown used)

## üßπ Data Cleaning
### Steps performed:
    - Replaced the Senior Citizen column observrations.
    - Replaced the Paperless Billing column observations
    - Reorder the Churn status

## üìà Key Analysis Steps
**1. Loading Packages:**
```r
  library(dplyr)
  library(ggplot2)
  library(scales)
  library(tidyverse)
```

**2. Importing the Data:**
```r
  setwd(folder/inpudata)
  customer_data <- read.csv("customer_data.csv")
```

**3. Data Cleaning:** standardized date formats.
  ```r
  # Replace the senior citizen & Paperless billing column Observations.
      customer_data <- customer_data %>% 
      mutate(SeniorCitizen = 
               case_when(SeniorCitizen ==0 ~ "Senior",
                SeniorCitizen ==1 ~ "Young_Middle_aged")) %>% 
      mutate(PaperlessBilling = 
               case_when(PaperlessBilling == "Yes" ~ "E-Bill",
                         PaperlessBilling == "No"~"Paper Bill"))

# Reorder the Churn status
      customer_data$Churn <- factor(customer_data$Churn, levels = c("Yes", "No"))      
```

# üí° Insights & Recommendations
  
  - Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn.
  - New customers (tenure < 12 months) are at higher risk.
  - Electronic check users show higher churn rates.
  - High monthly charges may be a churn driver.
  - Consider offering incentives for long-term contracts.

# üìà Visualization with Insights
   
  **Churn distribution across Customers**

    ![Customer Churn rate distribution](https://github.com/Saravanan-dataworks/Customer-Churn-Analysis/blob/main/Customer%20Churn%20rate%20distribution.png)

  **Contract Type Strongly Influences Churn**

   - Customers with month-to-month contracts have a significantly higher churn rate compared to those on one-year or two-year contracts. 
    This suggests that longer-term contracts may help reduce churn.
   - Promote vouchers for longer-term contracts.

    ![Churn rate by Contract](https://github.com/Saravanan-dataworks/Customer-Churn-Analysis/blob/main/Churn%20rate%20by%20Contract.png)

  **Tenure is a Key Indicator**
  
   - Customers who have been with the company for a shorter period (0‚Äì12 months) are more likely to churn.
   - Retention efforts should focus on new customers during their first year.

     ![Churn rate by tenure](https://github.com/Saravanan-dataworks/Customer-Churn-Analysis/blob/main/Churn%20rate%20by%20tenure.png)

  **Electronic Check Users Are More Likely to Churn**
   
   - Customers who pay via electronic check show a higher churn rate than those using credit cards or bank transfers.
   - This could indicate a correlation between payment method and customer satisfaction or stability.

     ![Churn rate based on Payment type](https://github.com/Saravanan-dataworks/Customer-Churn-Analysis/blob/main/Churn%20rate%20based%20on%20Payment%20type.png)

  **High Monthly Charges Correlate with Churn**

   - Customers with higher monthly charges tend to churn more.
   - This could be due to perceived value or affordability issues..

  **Paperless Billing Preference**

   - Customers who opt for paperless billing may be more tech-savvy but also more likely to switch providers if dissatisfied.
   - This group may respond well to digital engagement strategies.

  **Internet Service Type Matters**

    - Customers using fiber optic or DSL services churn more than those without internet service. 
    - This could point to service quality or pricing concerns.

# Recommendations & Campaign ideas:
  **1. Target High-Risk Segments**
        Insight: Customers with month-to-month contracts show significantly higher churn rates.
        
        Action:
        
        - Introduce loyalty programs or discounts for customers who switch to longer-term contracts.
        - Offer personalized retention incentives (e.g., free upgrades or reduced fees) for month-to-month customers.
        
  **2. Improve Customer Experience for Low-Tenure Users**
        
        Insight: Churn is higher among customers with short tenure (e.g., <12 months).
        
        Action:
        
        - Implement onboarding programs to engage new customers early.
        - Use proactive customer support (e.g., check-ins, satisfaction surveys) during the first few months.
        
  **3. Review Pricing Strategy**
  
        Insight: Customers with higher monthly charges tend to churn more.
        
        Action:
        
        - Re-evaluate pricing tiers and ensure value alignment.
        - Offer bundled services or discounts for high-paying customers to increase perceived value.
        
  **4. Address Internet Service Issues**
        Insight: Churn varies significantly by Internet service type.
        
        Action:
        
        - Investigate service quality issues (e.g., speed, reliability) for high-churn service types.
        - Provide service upgrades or satisfaction guarantees for affected customers.
  **5. Optimize Payment Methods**
        Insight: Certain payment methods are associated with higher churn.
        
        Action:
        
        - Encourage auto-pay or credit card payments through incentives (e.g., cashback, discounts).
        - Simplify payment processes and improve transparency in billing.
        
  **6. Promote Paperless Billing**
        Insight: Customers using paperless billing may show different churn patterns.
        
        Action:
        
        - Promote paperless billing with benefits like faster processing and eco-friendly messaging.
        - Ensure digital billing platforms are user-friendly and reliable.
